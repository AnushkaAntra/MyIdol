                <p>Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 in Vadnagar, Gujarat. He was the third child born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi and Hiraben Modi. When eight years old, Modi was introduced to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began attending its local shakhas.  He completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967. Modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across Northern and North-eastern India. Modi's first known political activity as an adult was in 1971 and then became a full-time pracharak for the RSS, working under Inamdar. In 1978 Modi received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the School of Open Learning (SOL) at the University of Delhi. Five years later, in 1983, he received a Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat University.</p>

                <p>Modi was sworn in as Chief Minister on 7 October 2001,[100] and entered the Gujarat state legislature on 24 February 2002.As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS.Gujarat was ranked first among Indian states for "economic freedom" by a report measuring governance, growth, citizens' rights and labour and business regulation among the country's 20 largest states. Modi served as the CM of Gujrat for 12 consecutives years.</p>
                <p>In September 2013 Modi was named the BJP's candidate for prime minister ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election. The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modi's commitment to secularism. The BJP's campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media. BJP became the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984 in 2014 lokSabha elections and Modi was sworn in as the Prime Minister of India on 26 May 2014. He became the first Prime Minister born after India's independence from the British Empire in 1947.

Modi launched the Main Bhi Chowkidar campaign ahead of the general election.Modi was unanimously appointed the prime minister for a second time by the National Democratic Alliance,[206] after the alliance won the election for the second time by securing 353 seats in the Lok Sabha with the BJP alone won 303 seats. On 6 December 2020, Modi became the 4th longest serving Prime Minister of India and the longest serving Non-Congress Prime Minister.</p>
